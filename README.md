# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
When I did Project 2, I added code within the main loop of the application. This code allowed the agent to decide the action strategy through exploration and exploitation.

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Simply put, computer scientists perform the scientific method of hypothesis, experimentation, and analysis each and every day whether it be trying a new technology in their code base or coming up with new methods to optimize already existing procedures.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I believe the biggest challenges facing those new in this industry involve simply being able to define a problem. This means properly defining a scope of the problem as well as identifying the components of the system that needs to be addressed. Once these two steps are established it is just a matter of determining the flow of data. These three ingredients can lead to anyone being able to create a solution to any problem.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
It's difficult to give a concrete answer to this question in that I don't want to 'hard code' ethical rules that prevent me from providing the service requested from my end user or that are overly stringent. I would think the best approach is always honesty, the difference in many cases of ethics between moral and immoral is that of consent. If there is a reasonable belief that the end user has a good understanding of how their data is being used then the ethic has been resolved.
